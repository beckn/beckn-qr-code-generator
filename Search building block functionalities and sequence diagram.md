## Task: Search Building Block Functionalities and Sequence Diagram

### List of Functionalities to be Handled by Backend to Implement the Search Building Block

1. **Search Query Processing:**
   - Receive and process search queries from the UI.
   - Extract relevant parameters and keywords from the query.

2. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Fetch data from the database or external APIs based on the search query.
   - Retrieve services or products matching the search criteria.

3. **Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Apply filters (e.g., price range, location, ratings) to narrow down search results.
   - Sort the search results based on specified criteria (e.g., price, popularity).

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the UI.
   - Address issues like empty results or server errors.

5. **Response Formatting:**
   - Format the search results in a standardized way to be sent back to the UI.
   - Ensure the response includes essential details like service names, descriptions, and relevant metadata.

6. **Data Validation:**
   - Validate incoming search queries to ensure they meet the required format and criteria, like JSON Stringification, etc.

7. **User Authentication:**
   - If user authentication is required for specific search functionalities (e.g., personalized results), handle user authentication and authorization.

8. **Caching:**
   - Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed search results and reduce response times.

### Sequence Diagram

The above sequence diagram can be explained by following steps:

1. The UI application sends a search query to the backend server.
2. The backend server retrieves data from the database or external APIs based on the search query.
3. The backend server applies filtering and sorting to the results as per Beckn protocol requirements.
4. The backend formats the search results and sends them back to the UI application.
5. The UI application displays the search results to the user.
